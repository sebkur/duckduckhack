# DuckDuckHack reuse

A testing repository to make some of the Instant Answers from DuckDuckHack
usable outside of the DuckDuckGo homepage.

See the [Github pages](https://sebkur.github.io/duckduckhack/) for a live
demonstration of what is working and what not.

See [duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-goodies](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-goodies)
for the source.
